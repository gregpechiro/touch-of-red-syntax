# Touch of Red Syntax Theme

This is a dark syntax theme that adds red accents. It is based off of [Atom's One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax).
None of the language syntax was changed. Only editor background, highlighting, cursor, and gutter colors.

It is designed to go with the [Touch of Red UI theme](https://atom.io/packages/touch-of-red-ui). See Bellow
